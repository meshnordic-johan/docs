## The basics

We support product feeds as JSON, CSV or XML. The feed should be refreshed at least every hour - otherwise it will take too much time for your product updates to take effect on your site.

<tip>
One feed per market

If your site has multiple markets, you need to provide a product feed for each of them. Each feed should then contain the correct URLs, translations and prices for that market.

## Product Feed specification

### Mandatory product attributes
These are attributes required by Depict for all products in your feed. These attributes are essential for the successful representation of your product data.

The following table shows the minimum required product attributes, their accepted data types, and descriptions:



<ResponseField name="Title" type="string" required>
The productâ€™s name. Example value: 'Blue Men's T-Shirt'.

<ResponseField name="Product ID" type="string" required>
Identify each product using the product ID attribute. This attribute must be unique across all of your products. This attribute should also be at the lowest possible level.If a T-shirt comes in sizes S,M,L, then each size should have its own product id. Example value: 'ABC1234'.

<ResponseField name="SKU" type="string" required>
A unique identifier for all possible variants of a product. This might be shared across products.If a T-shirt comes in sizes S,M,L they could share the same SKU but have different product IDs.This ID must be the same ID used in Google Analytics for transactions of this product. Example value: 'ABCD1234'.

<ResponseField name="Item group ID" type="string" required>
A unique identifier for each group of variants. The item group ID identifies a set of products that differ by one or more variant attributes, such as color, size, etc.If a T-shirt comes in sizes S,M,L and colors Black and White, the 6 products should have the same item group ID. Example value: 'ABCD12345'.

### Custom product attributes
In addition to all the attributes listed above, you can also include completely custom attributes. This data will be stored alongside the product and can then be used to setup filters, rankings, and custom scoring.
