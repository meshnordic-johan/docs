## The basics

We support product feeds as JSON, CSV or XML. The feed should be refreshed at least every hour - otherwise it will take too much time for your product updates to take effect on your site.

<tip>
One feed per market

If your site has multiple markets, you need to provide a product feed for each of them. Each feed should then contain the correct URLs, translations and prices for that market.
