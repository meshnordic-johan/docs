## The basics

We support product feeds as JSON, CSV or XML. The feed should be refreshed at least every hour - otherwise it will take too much time for your product updates to take effect on your site.

<tip>
One feed per market

If your site has multiple markets, you need to provide a product feed for each of them. Each feed should then contain the correct URLs, translations and prices for that market.

## Product Feed specification

### Mandatory product attributes
These are attributes required by Depict for all products in your feed. These attributes are essential for the successful representation of your product data.

The following table shows the minimum required product attributes, their accepted data types, and descriptions:



<ResponseField name="Title" type="string" required>
The productâ€™s name. Example value: Blue Men's T-Shirt.



<br/>
### Custom product attributes
In addition to all the attributes listed above, you can also include completely custom attributes. This data will be stored alongside the product and can then be used to setup filters, rankings, and custom scoring.
